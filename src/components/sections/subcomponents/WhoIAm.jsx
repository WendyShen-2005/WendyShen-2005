                My name is Wendy and I'm a second year computer security student at York Univeristy! 
                I have enjoyed and explored programming ever since I was in grade 4, starting from when my brother introduced me to scratch.
                <br/><br/>
                Since then, I have explored various fields, but always come back to programming. 
                <br/><br/>
                During my time as a student, I have taken the following courses in university: Introduction to OOP, Software Tools (in progress), Advanced OOP (in progress) and Computer Organization (in progress). 
                This has helped me become proficient in Java, HTML/CSS/JS, and C. I also learned Python in highschool.
                <br/><br/>
                In my free time, I have also been actively trying to learn SQL, backend programming, and cloud technologies. I have become proficient in React.js and Next.js.
